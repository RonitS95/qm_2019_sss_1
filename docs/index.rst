Welcome to qm_sss_2019_group_1 documentation!
=========================================================

This module has the method discussed by Dr. Jonathan Moussa in the MolSSI 2019 Summer School QM Project. In short, this 
method is a semiempirical model which runs Hartree Fock calculations and MP2 corrections on a system of Nobel Gases. 
While this is not true in the most strictest sense, this model gives remotely acceptable results for a specific type of
system, and Nobel Gases fit them. 

Here, we are discussing the results for Argon, but if you have the relevant data, you can run it for your model too.
